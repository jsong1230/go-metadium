# go-metadium

Metadium blockchain node implementation, forked from [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) v1.13.14.

## What is Metadium?

Metadium is a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain with on-chain governance. It uses a custom consensus layer built on top of go-ethereum's ethash engine, with block signing via node keys and reward distribution through governance smart contracts.

**Current version:** 1.1.3-stable (Camellia fork)

## Camellia Fork

Camellia is Metadium's hard fork that activates Ethereum's Shanghai and Cancun EIPs in a single upgrade:

| Network | Activation block | Activation time |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Testnet | 86,449,000 | 2026-05-20 12:00 KST (activated) |
| Mainnet | 117,764,000 | 2026-08-27 12:00 KST (scheduled) |

Nodes must run this release before the mainnet activation block; older binaries will follow a diverging chain.

| EIP | Feature | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|
| EIP-3855 | PUSH0 opcode | Verified |
| EIP-1153 | Transient storage (TLOAD/TSTORE) | Verified |
| EIP-5656 | MCOPY opcode | Verified |
| EIP-3651 | Warm COINBASE | Verified |
| EIP-6780 | SELFDESTRUCT restriction | Verified |
| EIP-3860 | Initcode size limit (507904 bytes) | Verified |
| EIP-4844 | Blob transactions (Type 3) | Verified |
| Type 22 | Fee delegation transactions | Verified |

See [docs/camellia-test-report.md](docs/camellia-test-report.md) for full test results.

## Key Differences from go-ethereum

- **Consensus:** Metadium PoA (not PoW/PoS). Block signing via `MinerNodeId`/`MinerNodeSig` header fields.
- **Protocol:** `meta/66` and `meta/68` (not `eth/68`). Backward compatible with existing mainnet nodes.
- **Header fields:** Extra fields `Fees`, `Rewards`, `MinerNodeId`, `MinerNodeSig` in block headers.
- **Governance:** On-chain governance contracts for validator management and reward distribution.
- **Fee delegation:** Type 22 transactions where a fee payer covers gas costs on behalf of the sender.
- **Block time:** 2 seconds (vs Ethereum's 12 seconds).
- **Network:** Mainnet (ChainID 11, 9 PoA nodes), Testnet (ChainID 12, 3 PoA nodes).

## Building

Prerequisites: Go 1.21+, C compiler (for RocksDB builds).

These are the Makefile targets CI validates. They build against whatever the
host provides, which is what you want for development — but **not** for
anything you publish or deploy; see [Release artifacts](#release-artifacts).

```bash
make gmet                    # gmet binary (RocksDB; USE_ROCKSDB=NO for LevelDB)
make metadium                # full deploy bundle: build/metadium.tar.gz (bin/ + conf/)
```

### Release artifacts

Artifacts that are published or deployed to nodes **must** be built through the
container target, never on the build host directly:

```bash
make gmet-linux                     # RocksDB
make gmet-linux USE_ROCKSDB=NO      # LevelDB
USE_ROCKSDB=NO make gmet-linux      # LevelDB, from the environment
```

The container build defaults to RocksDB regardless of the build host, because
the host's `uname` must not pick the engine for a Linux container. `USE_ROCKSDB`
is honoured when you set it explicitly, either on the command line or in the
environment.

`make gmet-linux` builds `Dockerfile.metadium` and compiles inside it. Three
properties come from that image and nothing else guarantees them:

- its base pins the oldest glibc the artifacts have to run against (Ubuntu
  20.04). Building on the host bakes in the host's glibc instead, and the
  result does not start anywhere older:
  `gmet: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.38' not found`
- it sets `STATIC_STDCPP=YES`, which links libstdc++ from its archive so the
  binary carries no `GLIBCXX`/`CXXABI` requirement either. Host builds keep the
  shared libstdc++ so a plain development box still links.
- its toolchain is pinned: the base image by digest, gcc/g++ by package version,
  and the Go tarball by checksum. The Go version itself lives in `.go-version`,
  which CI reads too, so release binaries are built with the toolchain CI ran.
  `make gmet-linux` refuses to build if that file and the Dockerfile disagree.

`gmet-linux` runs `make release-check` on the result and fails the build if an
artifact would not run on the fleet. Run it standalone against anything you are
about to publish:

```bash
make release-check                  # ceiling from MAX_GLIBC (default 2.31)
```

It covers every ELF in `build/bin` — `logrot` ships in the same bundle and has
its own glibc floor — and prints each artifact's `NEEDED` list. It refuses to
report success without having checked something: a file `objdump` cannot read,
an `objdump` that is not GNU binutils, and an empty `build/bin` are all
failures rather than quiet passes. A statically linked artifact is reported as
having no dynamic symbol table, which is a different line from a clean dynamic
one. Those shared
libraries (snappy, lz4, zstd, jemalloc) must exist on the target host; the
symbol-version checks passing does not by itself make an artifact runnable on a
freshly installed machine.

Two consequences of building this way are standing rules rather than build steps,
and they live in
[docs/release-build-toolchain.md](docs/release-build-toolchain.md): a toolchain
CVE means a rebuild and a re-release, because the statically linked libstdc++ is
no longer reachable by a distro update, and the move off the 20.04 base is gated
on the fleet, with `MAX_GLIBC` as the last step rather than the first.

Direct `go build` works for development — **these produce non-portable binaries
and must not be published** (`./cmd/gmet` and `./cmd/geth` are the same
entrypoint; the Makefile uses `./cmd/gmet`):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o gmet ./cmd/gmet                    # LevelDB
CGO_ENABLED=1 CGO_LDFLAGS="-lrocksdb -lstdc++ -lm -lz -lbz2 -lsnappy -llz4 -lzstd" \
  go build -tags rocksdb -o gmet ./cmd/gmet                  # RocksDB
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t gmet:latest .
```

## Running

### Mainnet

```bash
gmet --mainnet --datadir /data/gmet-mainnet \
  --http --http.addr 127.0.0.1 --http.port 8588 \
  --http.api eth,net,web3,admin,debug
```

### Testnet

```bash
gmet --metadium-testnet --datadir /data/gmet-testnet \
  --http --http.addr 127.0.0.1 --http.port 8588 \
  --http.api eth,net,web3,admin,debug
```

### Private Network (Docker, 3 nodes)

```bash
cd tests/private-net-poa
./setup.sh    # Initialize and build Docker image
./start.sh    # Start 3-node PoA network (ports 8545/8546/8547)
./stop.sh     # Stop (data preserved)
```

## Upgrading from 0.10.x

v1.1.x rebases the tree onto go-ethereum v1.13.14 and changes several
operational defaults. An in-place upgrade (`gmet.sh stop` → extract tarball →
`gmet.sh start`) preserves the datadir, `geth/nodekey` and `.rc` exactly as
before — but review the following **before** restarting on the new binary.

### Upgrade checklist

1. **Upgrade before the activation block** — mainnet 117,764,000. The block
   height is authoritative; wall-clock estimates are approximate. Nodes on
   older binaries follow a diverging chain from that block on.
2. **Use the engine-matched tarball.** The DB engine is decided at build time.
   Check the node's chaindata before extracting: `.sst` files → rocksdb
   tarball, `.ldb` files → leveldb tarball. A mismatched binary cannot open
   the database.
3. **★ RPC/WS bind default changed** (`gmet.sh`): `--http.addr`/`--ws.addr`
   now default to **`127.0.0.1`** (was `0.0.0.0`). A node that serves RPC/WS
   to other machines — exchange wallet backends included — must add to its
   per-node `.rc` **before** restarting:

   ```bash
   HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0    # or a specific interface address
   WS_ADDR=0.0.0.0
   ```

   Without these, the upgraded node silently stops serving external clients
   while looking healthy in every other way.
4. **★ The `personal` RPC namespace is disabled by default.** Upstream
   deprecated it: the node only registers `personal_*` (including
   `personal_unlockAccount` and `personal_sendTransaction`, common in
   exchange wallet backends) when started with
   `--rpc.enabledeprecatedpersonal`. `gmet.sh` does not pass it. Same failure
   shape as the bind change: the node comes up healthy and the backend stops
   working. If your tooling uses `personal_*`, **two** things are required:
   the enable flag *and* `personal` in the HTTP module list (the default is
   `net,web3` only) — e.g. in `.rc`:

   ```bash
   GMET_OPTS="--rpc.enabledeprecatedpersonal --http.api eth,net,web3,personal"
   ```

   (`gmet.sh` passes no `--http.api` of its own, so anyone using the
   namespace over HTTP is already supplying a module list — extend it.) And
   plan a migration off the namespace: upstream has removed it entirely in
   later releases.
5. **★ Metadium networks run full sync only — every other `--syncmode`
   refuses to start.** `light` is gone from the tree (0.10.x shipped `les/`;
   v1.1.x does not), and `snap`/`fast` are deliberately rejected on Metadium
   mainnet/testnet because the snap state-healing fixes are not backported to
   this base (state-corruption risk). If any launcher or unit file passes a
   `--syncmode` other than `full`, change it before restarting. (The guard
   exempts only the upstream test networks and `--dev` — private chains run
   off this binary are under it too.) For fast new-node bring-up, bootstrap
   from a published chain snapshot instead
   (`docs/sync-policy-and-snapshot-bootstrap.md`).
6. **`gmet.sh stop` semantics changed.** It now exits non-zero when the node
   did not actually stop (previously it could report success without stopping
   anything), and gained `.rc` tunables: `STOP_TIMEOUT` (seconds to wait for
   graceful shutdown before escalating, default `200`), `STOP_FORCE` (`0` =
   never SIGKILL, exit non-zero instead; default `1`), `LOCK_TIMEOUT`
   (default `200`). One coupling to understand: **under the default
   `STOP_FORCE=1`, a node that outlives `STOP_TIMEOUT` is SIGKILLed by the
   script itself and `stop` still exits 0** — the exit code only guarantees
   a graceful shutdown when `STOP_FORCE=0` is set. Automation must check the
   exit code *and* set `STOP_FORCE=0`, sizing its own timeout above
   `STOP_TIMEOUT`. Never `kill -9` a node — RocksDB especially.
7. **Testnet operators: skip 1.1.0, go straight to the m1.1.2 release
   build.** The 1.1.0 testnet build carries a chain-config regression that
   rewinds a 0.10.x node to block 5,622,999 (~80M-block resync) on first
   start. The fix landed *after* the version string moved to 1.1.1, so
   "reports 1.1.1-stable" does not prove a build is safe — use the official
   m1.1.2 release asset (its exact commit hash is published in the release
   notes). **Do not use the m1.1.1 assets**: they were built against glibc
   2.39 and require `GLIBC_2.38`, so they do not start on 20.04 or 22.04.
   Self-builders can check their commit contains the fix with
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor e2c0d7413 <your-commit>` (exit 0 = fixed).
   Order matters on the remediation too: run testnet
   nodes with `--metadium-testnet` (or `TESTNET=1` in `.rc`) **only once on
   a fixed build** — adding the flag while still on a pre-fix binary is
   exactly what arms the rewind.
8. **RPC fee cap**: `gmet.sh` now passes `--rpc.txfeecap 0`, preserving the
   0.10.x behaviour of no cap on `eth_sendTransaction` fees. Operators who
   launch `gmet` directly without this flag get upstream's default 1-ether
   cap — set it explicitly if your tooling sends high-fee transactions.
9. **Direct-CLI launchers**: the flag surface is upstream go-ethereum
   v1.13.14. If you maintain a custom launch script or systemd unit instead
   of `gmet.sh`, dry-run it against the new binary (`gmet --help`); the only
   `--syncmode` that starts on Metadium networks is `full` (item 5). systemd
   unit templates are provided at `metadium/scripts/gmet.service` (plus a
   sealer override).
   Two `--log` behaviour changes for such launchers: the flag's usage string
   used to document the wrong argument order — the parsed one is
   `<file-name>,<size>,<count>`, the same order as `logrot <file> <size>
   <count>` — and a `--log` value that fails to parse, or asks for a
   non-positive size or count, now stops the node at startup instead of
   silently running without rotation (following the documented-but-wrong
   order used to produce a 5-byte size and ten million generations). The
   standalone `logrot` also exits 1 rather than 0 when invoked with the
   wrong number of arguments, so supervisors notice a missing drainer.
10. **`metadium/metclient` library users**: signature changes —
    `SendValue`'s `amount` went `int` → `*big.Int`, and `_gasPrice` went
    `int` → `int64` in both `SendValue` and `Deploy` (`gas` is unchanged).
    `SendValue` call sites fail at compile time; **`Deploy` call sites that
    pass a constant gas price compile unchanged** (untyped constants satisfy
    `int64`) — audit those by hand. Note `amount` may now be `nil`, which is
    a 0-value transfer rather than an error.

Transaction-behaviour note: the pool admits transactions of code plus
constructor data up to 256KB total, restoring 0.10.x parity — 0.10.x has
carried the same 256KB ceiling since 2018, so a mixed 0.10.x + 1.1.x fleet
behaves uniformly. Only the intermediate **1.1.0** line rejected above
128KB: propagation of 128–256KB transactions is path-dependent only while
1.1.0 nodes are present (relevant on testnet; the mainnet fleet upgrades
straight from 0.10.x).

## Node Configuration Reference (`gmet.sh` / `.rc`)

The standard deployment runs `gmet` through `bin/gmet.sh`, which reads the
node's configuration from a `.rc` file in the datadir (`/opt/meta/.rc` in the
stock layout). Every knob, with its default:

| `.rc` variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | unset | When set: HTTP-RPC = `PORT`, WS = `PORT+10`, p2p = `PORT+1`. When unset, `gmet.sh` passes no port flags and the binary defaults apply: HTTP **8545**, WS **8546**, p2p **8589**. `init`-generated `.rc` files set `PORT=8588`. |
| `HTTP_ADDR` / `WS_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1` | RPC / WS bind address. Set `0.0.0.0` (or a specific interface) only on nodes that must serve other machines. |
| `TESTNET` | unset | `1` → `--metadium-testnet`. Anything else is ignored. |
| `DISCOVER` | unset (on) | `0` → `--nodiscover`. Note **`init`-generated `.rc` files contain `DISCOVER=0`** — remove or change it for ordinary full nodes, or the node dials no one. Mainnet/testnet bootnodes are compiled into the binary, so no `BOOT_NODES` is needed. |
| `SYNC_MODE` | unset (**archive**) | `full` → pruned full node (recommended for exchange/API nodes, ~600GB-class). **Unset — or any unrecognized value, typos included — means `--syncmode full --gcmode archive`**: a multi-TB archive node. `fast`/`snap` make the node exit at startup (Metadium networks are full-sync only) — and since `gmet.sh start` backgrounds the node, `start` itself still returns 0, so check the log. |
| `BOOT_NODES` | unset | Extra `--bootnodes` enodes (rarely needed, see above). |
| `GMET_OPTS` | unset | Extra flags appended verbatim to the command line. |
| `STOP_TIMEOUT` | `200` | Seconds `gmet.sh stop` waits for graceful shutdown before escalating. |
| `STOP_FORCE` | `1` | `0` = never SIGKILL; `stop` exits non-zero instead (recommended for RocksDB nodes and anything driven by automation). |
| `LOCK_TIMEOUT` | `200` | Seconds to wait for the chaindata lock to be released after exit. |
| `COINBASE`, `HUB`, `MAX_TXS_PER_BLOCK`, `NONCE_LIMIT` | unset | Special-purpose (sealer / relay setups); ordinary full nodes leave these alone. |

The stop knobs also take one-shot environment overrides
(`STOP_TIMEOUT=1800 gmet.sh stop`) without editing the `.rc`.

### Example: exchange / API full node

```bash
# /opt/meta/.rc -- pruned mainnet full node serving RPC to internal backends
PORT=8588
SYNC_MODE=full          # pruned; omit this line only if you need an archive node
HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0       # internal backends connect over the network
WS_ADDR=0.0.0.0         # (firewall the ports -- these binds are not auth)
STOP_TIMEOUT=1800
STOP_FORCE=0            # never SIGKILL; fail loudly and retry instead
```

Equivalent direct invocation without `gmet.sh`:

```bash
gmet --datadir /opt/meta --syncmode full \
  --http --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.port 8588 --http.api eth,net,web3 \
  --ws --ws.addr 0.0.0.0 --ws.port 8598 \
  --port 8589 --rpc.txfeecap 0 --metrics
```

Deploy/upgrade cycle (datadir, `geth/nodekey` and `.rc` live outside the
tarball and survive):

```bash
cd /opt/meta
bin/gmet.sh stop        # graceful; see item 6 -- exit 0 under the default
                        # STOP_FORCE=1 may still hide an internal SIGKILL
tar xzvf metadium-<version>-linux-<leveldb|rocksdb>.tar.gz
                        # ^ the GitHub release asset name; `make metadium`
                        #   itself produces build/metadium.tar.gz
bin/gmet.sh start
bin/gmet version        # verify the Git Commit line (gmet version prints
                        # no fork or engine info)
grep -m1 Camellia logs/log   # fork config is printed at chain init --
                             # expect the Camellia activation height
```
