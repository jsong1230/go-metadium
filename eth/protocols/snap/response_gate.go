// This file keeps a snap response from being decoded before we know we asked
// for it. It is the counterpart of eth/protocols/eth/response_gate.go, and the
// reason it exists separately is that this protocol reaches the same hazard by
// a different route.
//
// Nothing on this network snap-syncs — the fork refuses --syncmode snap — but
// the response handlers are reachable all the same, because what exposes them
// is capability negotiation rather than our sync mode: Ethereum.Protocols
// appends snap/1 whenever SnapshotCache is above zero, and that defaults to
// 102. So a node running --syncmode full advertises snap, and its handlers used
// to decode a response in full before AccountRangePacket.ID was compared
// against anything.
//
// Never snap-syncing is in fact what makes this worse rather than better: with
// no request outstanding, the id can match nothing, and the syncer's handling
// of an id it does not know is to log and return nil — the peer is not dropped,
// so one connection can repeat the same message indefinitely. Bytecodes and
// trie nodes are [][]byte with no ordering constraint to satisfy on the way in,
// which makes them the cheapest shape: the wire size is capped by
// maxMessageSize, the size of the Go values it expands into is not.
//
// The gate reads the leading request id, checks it against the ids this peer
// was actually sent, and decodes the payload only then.
//
// Why not the envelope struct the eth gate uses: there, every response is
// `[request-id, payload]` — two elements, so leaving the second as
// rlp.RawValue is enough. Snap's responses are flat lists whose first element
// happens to be the id (`[id, accounts, proof]`), so there is no payload
// element to hold back. peekRequestID therefore reads the id off a stream over
// the already-buffered message and stops, and the full decode re-reads those
// same bytes once the gate has passed. Buffering the message costs its wire
// size, which the maxMessageSize check above the handler has already bounded;
// it is the expansion that the gate is there to prevent.

// maxPendingIDs bounds the index, as a ring: inserting past capacity evicts the
// oldest id.
//
// Snap has no dispatcher, so a request is only untracked when its answer
// arrives (or when the send fails). An unanswered request would otherwise sit
// in the index for the life of the connection. The syncer's real concurrency is
// a handful of requests per peer, so eviction only ever reaches ids that have
// long gone unanswered — and on this network the index stays empty, since
// nothing sends snap requests at all.
